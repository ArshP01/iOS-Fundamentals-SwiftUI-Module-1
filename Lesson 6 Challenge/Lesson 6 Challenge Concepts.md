Step 1

We’re going to be trying out some math operations in a Swift Playground. 

Open Xcode and create a new playground  

(File Menu->New->Playground).  

From the list of Playground templates, just select “Blank” 



Step 2

Type out the following basic math operations:

You can even use the math operators with variables like this: 

(Type this out in your playground too)

Step 3

If you want to increment a variable, you can use it as part of the equation (the variable must 

already have a value) and reassign the new result to itself. Try the following lines in your 

Playground:

Step 4

Here are some additional math operators to try in your playground:
